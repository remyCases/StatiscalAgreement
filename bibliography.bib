abstract = {The correct approach to analyzing method agreement is discussed. Whether we are considering agreement between two measurements on the same samples (repeatability) or two individuals using identical methodology on identical samples (reproducibility) or comparing two methods, appropriate procedures are described, and worked examples are shown. The correct approaches for both categorical and numerical variables are explained. More complex analyses involving a comparison of more than two pairs of data are mentioned and guidance for these analyses given. Simple formulae for calculating the approximate sample size needed for agreement analysis are also given. Examples of good practice from the reproduction literature are cited, and common errors of methodology are indicated.}

abstract = {A 95\% confidence interval (CI) of the mean is a range with an upper and lower number calculated from a sample. Because the true population mean is unknown, this range describes possible values that the mean could be. If multiple samples were drawn from the same population and a 95\% CI calculated for each sample, we would expect the population mean to be found within 95\% of these CIs. CIs are sensitive to variability in the population (spread of values) and sample size. When used to compare the means of two or more treatment groups, a CI shows the magnitude of a difference between groups. This is helpful in understanding both the statistical significance and the clinical significance of a treatment. In this article we describe the basic principles of CIs and their interpretation.},

 abstract = {A new reproducibility index is developed and studied. This index is the correlation between the two readings that fall on the 45âš¬ line through the origin. It is simple to use and possesses desirable properties. The statistical properties of this estimate can be satisfactorily evaluated using an inverse hyperbolic tangent transformation. A Monte Carlo experiment with 5,000 runs was performed to confirm the estimate's validity. An application using actual data is given.},
